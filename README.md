# Movie Recommendation System

This repository hosts a simple movie recommendation system built using the MovieLens dataset and Python's Pandas library for data manipulation. The system leverages genre-based similarity to suggest movies to users.

## About the Project

This project aims to provide movie recommendations by analyzing the relationships between movie genres. It's a foundational system that demonstrates how data manipulation with Pandas can be used to build a basic recommendation engine.

## Features

* **Genre-Based Similarity:** Recommends movies based on the similarity of their genres.
* **Data Manipulation with Pandas:** Utilizes Pandas for efficient handling and transformation of the MovieLens dataset.
* **Pivot Table Implementation:** Employs pivot tables to organize and aggregate movie data for similarity calculations.

## Data Source

The system uses the **MovieLens Dataset**, an open-source dataset widely used for building and testing recommendation algorithms. Specifically, it relies on the movie and rating data to extract genre information.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Pandas:** A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python.

## Methodology

1.  **Data Loading:** The MovieLens dataset (specifically, movies and ratings data) is loaded into Pandas DataFrames.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.
3.  **Pivot Table Creation:** A pivot table is constructed to represent the relationship between movies and their genres, often incorporating user ratings or other relevant metrics.
4.  **Similarity Calculation:** The system calculates the similarity between movie genres. This often involves techniques like cosine similarity or correlation on the pivot table.
5.  **Recommendation Generation:** Based on the calculated similarities, movies are sorted, and recommendations are generated. For example, if a user likes a movie from a certain genre, other movies with high similarity to that genre are recommended.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git](https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git)
    cd movie-recommendation-system
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username or the repository's URL)*

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

3.  **Download the MovieLens dataset:**
    * You will need to download the `ml-latest-small.zip` (or a similar version) from the official MovieLens website: [https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
    * Extract the contents of the zip file into a `data` directory within your project's root folder. Ensure `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` are accessible.

## Usage

*(Add instructions here on how to run your script, e.g., if you have a `main.py`)*

```bash
python your_main_script.py
```
*(Replace `your_main_script.py` with the actual name of your Python script that runs the recommendation logic)*

You might need to modify the script to specify a user ID or a movie to get recommendations for.
